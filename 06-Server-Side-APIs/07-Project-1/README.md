## The Task

For Project #1, we were tasked to work in a group to build a web application from scratch that solves a real-world problem and deliver a presentation of the final product. 

Our group decided to create a biking trail web application that provides a tool for users to search bike trails and current weather conditions for a particular location. 

## User Story

```

I WANT 
SO THAT 
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```

```

Description:
Peak Fitness uses a combination of Bulma CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and JQuery to provide users with up-to-date weather data and trail information in their area. 

User instructions:
Enter your location information
Click the submit button
Find a list of local trails and the current weather
Enjoy your hike!

(with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
